                    <strong>Early life and education :</strong>Kapil Dev Nikhanj[14] was born in a Punjabi Hindu family to Ram Lal Nikhanj, a teak merchant and his wife, Rajkumari in Chandigarh on 6 January 1959.[15][16] His family moved to Fazilka after the partition before eventually moving to Chandigarh. His paternal family is from Montgomery (now known as Sahiwal) and his mother was born in Pakpattan but raised in Okara, both now in Punjab, Pakistan.[17][18][19] Dev was a student at D. A. V. College

                  <p><strong>International career :</strong>Dev debuted as India's captain in the 1982–83 season against Sri Lanka (before the Pakistan tour) when Gavaskar was rested. His first assignment as regular captain was the tour of West Indies, where the biggest accomplishment was a lone ODI victory. Dev (72) and Gavaskar (90) led India to a huge score – 282/5 in 47 overs and Dev's 2 wickets aided India to restrict West Indies for 255 and a victory[38] that Indian cricketers claim gave them the confidence to face the West Indies team in 1983 Cricket World Cup.[39] Overall, Dev had a good series in West Indies as he scored a century to save the second test match[40] as well as picking up 17 wickets</p>
